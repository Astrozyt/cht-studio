# Code of Conduct

> This project aims to be a welcoming, safe, and productive space for everyone. The rules below set expectations for behavior and explain how we respond to problems.

## Our Pledge

We, as maintainers and contributors, pledge to make participation in **CHT Studio** a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing humility and assuming good intent

Unacceptable behavior includes:

* Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
* Trolling, excessive rudeness, or personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment, including stalking or doxxing
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Violent threats or language; sexualized language or imagery
* Sustained disruption of discussions

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, docs, chats) and also when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns:

* Email: **Astrozyt@proton.me** (goes to the maintainers)
* Optionally use GitHub’s reporting tools for abusive content

We will review and respond to every report in **5 business days**. Your report will be kept confidential to the extent possible.

### What to include in a report (optional but helpful)

* What happened? Please describe the behavior
* Where did it happen? (Issue/PR/Discussion link, chat, etc.)
* When did it happen? (dates and time zone)
* Who was involved? (include yourself)
* Any additional context or evidence (screenshots, links)

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when addressing violations. The goals are proportionality, transparency, and learning.

1. **Correction**
   *Impact:* Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   *Consequence:* Private, written warning; guidance on expected behavior.

2. **Warning**
   *Impact:* A single incident or series of actions after a correction.
   *Consequence:* Warning and reminder of the Code of Conduct; potential temporary restrictions on participation.

3. **Temporary Ban**
   *Impact:* Serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   *Consequence:* Temporary ban from interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period.

4. **Permanent Ban**
   *Impact:* Demonstrating a pattern of violation, harassment, or aggression; refusal to cease unacceptable behavior.
   *Consequence:* Permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
