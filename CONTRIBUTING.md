# Contributing to CHT Studio

## Quick start
- `pnpm install`
- Dev app: `pnpm tauri dev`
- Build (frontend only): `pnpm build`  â€¢ Typecheck: `pnpm run typecheck` (if defined)

## Workflow
1. Fork + create a branch: `feat/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`
2. Small PRs welcome; include a short description + screenshots if UI
3. Write concise commit messages (Conventional Commits preferred)

## Code style
- TypeScript/React, Rust (fmt/clippy)
- Run `cargo fmt && cargo clippy` in `src-tauri/` before PR
